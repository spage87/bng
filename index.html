                            Army had half a day. As you may or may not know, Lindsay and I have hit a bit of a
                            rough patch. I'm half machine. I'm a monster.</p>

                            coward, and that's Brian Doyle Murray. No, what I'm calling you is a television actor.</p>
                        <p>That's why you always leave a note! It's called 'taking advantage.' It's what gets you
                            ahead in life. It's a hug, Michael. I'm hugging you. Across from where? I don't
                            understand the question, and I won't respond to it.</p>
